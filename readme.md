This app is designed to be a note taking app. However it could easily be used for a dozen other things (for example a grocery list). To create a new note click on "Add Note" in the header. Type the title and the text you would like in the marked inputs. To view the content of a note, just hover over the note you would like to view and click "View Note". To delete the note click "Delete". If you would like to delete all the notes click "Delete All" in the footer.

I have made this app work well on mobile devices. If you pin the app to the homescreen on an iPhone the ios.png file will be used for the icon.

I have included the unminfied, heavily commented versions of my files to make it easier to understand what I am doing.

This was a fun project for me as I have never worked with HTML5 localStorage before. I had to get around the problem of storing a large amount of data in one key by using JSON objects.

Have fun writing notes!
